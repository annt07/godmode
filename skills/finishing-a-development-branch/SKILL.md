# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

**Core principle:** Verify tests, resolve any conflicts, detect environment, present options, execute choice, clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## Step 1: Verify Tests

Run the project's full test suite (`npm test` / `cargo test` / `pytest` / `go test ./...`).

**If tests fail**, report the failures and stop — the menu comes after a green suite:

```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]
```

**If tests pass:** continue to Step 2.

## Step 2: Check for Merge Conflicts

Before attempting to integrate, check whether merging or rebasing with the base branch would produce conflicts:

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge-tree $(git merge-base HEAD origin/<base-branch>) HEAD origin/<base-branch>
```

**If conflicts exist:**

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Invoke `godmode:resolving-merge-conflicts` to resolve every conflict before proceeding. The skill walks you through finding primary sources for each side, preserving both intents where possible, and running the automated checks afterward.

Only continue to Step 3 after all conflicts are resolved and tests still pass.

## Step 3: Detect Environment

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
WORKTREE_PATH=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

This determines which menu to show and how cleanup works:

| State | Menu | Cleanup |
|-------|------|---------|
| `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (normal repo) | Standard 3 options | No worktree to clean up |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, named branch | Standard 3 options | Provenance-based (see Step 7) |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, detached HEAD | Reduced 2 options (no merge) | Externally managed — leave in place |

## Step 4: Determine Base Branch

The base branch is whatever this work forked from — usually named in the plan, the conversation, or the branch's upstream. If it is not already known, ask: "This branch split from <your best guess> — is that correct?" Confirm before merging: merging into the wrong base is expensive to undo.

## Step 5: Present Options

**Normal repo and named-branch worktree — present exactly these 3 options:**

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)

Which option?
```

**Detached HEAD — present exactly these 2 options:**

```
Implementation complete. You're on a detached HEAD (externally managed workspace).

1. Push as new branch and create a Pull Request
2. Keep as-is (I'll handle it later)

Which option?
```

Present the menu exactly as written. Wait for their answer; the integration decision is theirs.

## Step 6: Execute Choice

### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"

git checkout <base-branch>
git pull
git merge <feature-branch>
```

If the merge produces additional conflicts, invoke `godmode:resolving-merge-conflicts` again before proceeding.

Verify tests on the merged result. If tests fail: stop, leave the worktree and branch in place, and investigate — nothing has been pushed, so the merge is local and recoverable.

Once the merged result is green: clean up the worktree (Step 7), then delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
```

Then create the pull/merge request against <base-branch> with the forge's tooling, following the repo's PR template and conventions if present, and report the URL to your human partner.

Keep the worktree — your human partner iterates on PR feedback there.

### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

### If Your Human Partner Asks to Discard the Work

Confirm first:

```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for that exact confirmation. When it arrives, clean up the worktree (Step 7) and force-delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

## Step 7: Cleanup Workspace

**Runs for Option 1 and confirmed discards.** Options 2 and 3 always preserve the worktree.

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON`:** Normal repo, no worktree to clean up. Done.

**If `WORKTREE_PATH` is under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`:** We own cleanup:

```bash
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"
git worktree prune
```

**If removal is refused** (`contains modified or untracked files`): Never `--force` on your own initiative. Show your human partner what is at stake and ask:

```bash
git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" status --porcelain -uall
```

```
Worktree removal refused — these files were never committed:

<file list>

1. Commit them to <branch> before cleanup
2. Move them into <main repo root>
3. Delete them (unrecoverable)

Which?
```

Carry out the choice, then remove the worktree.

**Otherwise:** The host environment owns this workspace — leave it in place.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | yes | - | - | yes |
| 2. Create PR | - | yes | yes | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | yes | - |
| Discard (explicit request only) | - | - | - | yes (force) |

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Tests passed earlier this session" | Run the suite on the tree you are about to integrate. A green run only proves the tree it ran on. |
| "The conflict looks minor, I can just pick one side" | Invoke `godmode:resolving-merge-conflicts`. Minor-looking conflicts encode intent that only the history reveals. |
| "They obviously want it merged" | Integration is your human partner's decision. Present the menu and wait. |
| "The merged-result failure is probably flaky" | A failing merged result stops everything. Branch and worktree stay put while you investigate. |
| "The base branch is obviously main" | Confirm the fork point or ask. Merging into the wrong base is expensive to undo. |
